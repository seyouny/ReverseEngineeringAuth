# Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code

# Config
   * There exists config.json which contains several different environments that index.js from models will determine using process.env.NODE_ENV. If the environment is set it uses the set environment, otherwise it will manually create one.
   * Under middleware is isAuthenticated.js. This file checks for authentication of a user and redirects if not logged in.

# Models
 
   * index.js is in charge of going through all the data and setting the environment. It requires fs, path, sequelize, and config.json.
   * user.js defines fields, types, and information regarding the relevant table and database.

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the `Develop` folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, README markdown file, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose in as fine as detail as possible. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* A link to code repo that contains the code within the `Develop` directory. The repo should contain a tutorial written in markdown explaining how the application functions; a tutorial.

* The `Develop` directory should be updated with original comments on what the code is doing line-by-line. 

* Optionally - you may also include a video explaining the application in `Develop` directory and display that video in the README Doc. 

* Both the video and the written tutorial should include visual graphics to support your lesson. 

`Note`: With both cases, written tutorial and/or video tutorial:

* line-by-line commenting is expected within the code. 
* A formatted README that list a written introduction of the purpose of the application and a high level explanation of how it works. 

* **Detailed** explanation of how the application functions can be expressed in a **Video** **OR** a **Written Tutorial**
